\description{negtive log-likelihood for separate time series analysis, copula-based semiparametric method from Chen and Fan (2006), assuming t copula for each time series and Markov process of order one, with marginal distribution estimated by espirical CDF, and it is for correlation parameter estimation
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
logL.CF(par,Yk,dfs)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{par}{correlation parameter in the t copula function, will be obtained by minimizing the negtive log-likelihood
